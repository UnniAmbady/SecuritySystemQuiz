Question:      What is the role of access control systems in security?  


Modal Answer:  Access control systems regulate who can enter specific areas and at what times, using credentials like ID badges or biometrics to authenticate users.
Student Ans:  to regulate access in areas , zones or buildings

GPT Feedback:
Right points: Access control systems regulate who can enter specific areas.
Improve on: The answer lacks details about authentication methods and specific functions of access control systems. It should mention credentials like ID badges or biometrics.

Question:      What is the primary function of motion sensors in electronic detection systems?  

Modal Answer:  Motion sensors provide continuous monitoring and rapid alerts for unauthorized movement around fences and building perimeters.
Student Ans:  To  detection movement. Especially to sence there are people in a room or not.

GPT Feedback:
Right points: Motion sensors detect movement.
Improve on: "To detection movement" should be "To detect movement." "Especially to sence there are people in a room or not" should be "Especially to sense if there are people in a room."

Question:      What is the primary function of access control systems in building security?  

Modal Answer:  Access control systems regulate who can enter specific areas and at what times by authenticating users based on credentials.
Student Ans:  To control access. Only authorised persons can enter. Intruder is to be stopped.

GPT Feedback:
Right points: Access control regulates who can enter. Only authorized persons can enter.
Improve on: "To control access" is vague. Needs more detail. "Intruder is to be stopped" lacks context on how this is done.

Question:     What is the role of temperature sensors in a Building Automation System (BAS)?
Modal Answer: Temperature sensors form the backbone of a BAS by providing real-time data essential for modulating set-points, heating valve strokes, and chiller loads.
Student Ans:  To Measure the room Temperature and give the information to the Controller that will adjust the parameters to ensure the setpoint temperature is achieved.

GPT Feedback:
Right points: Temperature sensors measure room temperature and provide information to the controller.
Improve on: The answer lacks detail about how sensors modulate set-points, heating valve strokes, and chiller loads. It should mention "real-time data" and "backbone of a BAS."
Score: 80%
